# the_among_us_compiler_for_your_very_dearest_wishes
the among us compiler for your very dearest wishes is an exelent solution for the common consumer.

> **How to use:**

1. **Create a python file** which imports the compiler.py. You can import the libraries too.
2. **Write your code** by using the compiler's and libraries' functions and printing their output to the console (Console output = Compiler output!).
3. **Compile your code** using the following command `python path/to/program.py > path/to/script.auiabsbhhhhhtlircpuimldoioeppppppp`.

**In case you have not installed the among us programming language:**
1. Download the language from here: https://github.com/bytespacegames/AMONGUSISABIGSUSSYBAKAHAHAHAHAHATHISLANGUAGEISREALLYCOOLPLEASE/releases/tag/Release
   or clone the repository using: `git clone https://github.com/bytespacegames/AMONGUSISABIGSUSSYBAKAHAHAHAHAHATHISLANGUAGEISREALLYCOOLPLEASE.git`.
2. (Optional) add the location of the AmongUsLanguage.exe (Windows) or the AmongUsLanguage binary (Linux) to your path.
3. Create a script.auiabsbhhhhhtlircpuimldoioeppppppp file (the only possible name in the among us programming language).
4. Run the program by typing the command: `AmongUsLanguage`


**The linker:**

Run `linker.py [files] > executable.sh` to create an executable shell script that executes the files in the given order.

**FAQ:**

*Q:* Are you going to add windows support for your linker?
*A:* We are thinking about adding a ps-compatible version of the linker in the future but for now, windows users have to resort to vms. We recommend using **[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)** or **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**.
